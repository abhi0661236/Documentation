    <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>
    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very 
        popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3)
         is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting 
         edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners,
         also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
        <li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
        <li>Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.</li>
        <li>Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</li>
        <li>The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Learning</li>
                <li>GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )</li>
                <li>Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)</li>
                <li>Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)</li>
                <li>Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)</li>
                <li>Test frameworks</li>
                <li>Multimedia</li>
                <li>Scientific computing</li>
                <li>Text processing and many more..</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.
    </p>
    <h2>Beginning with Python programming:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Finding an Interpreter:</h3>
            <p>
                Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our programs. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Windows:</b>There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) that comes bundled with the Python software downloaded from http://python.org/.</p>
            <p><b>Linux:</b>Python comes preinstalled with popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu and Fedora. To check which version of Python you’re running, type “python” in the terminal emulator. The interpreter should start and print the version number.</p>
            <p><b>macOS: </b>Generally, Python 2.7 comes bundled with macOS. You’ll have to manually install Python 3 from http://python.org/.</p>

        </li>

        <li>
            <h3> Writing our first program:</h3>
            <p>Just type in the following code after you start the interpreter.</p>
            <code>
                # Script Begins <br>
  
    
  
                print("GeeksQuiz") <br>
  
    
  
                # Scripts Ends 
            </code>
            <p>Output:</p>
            <code>
                GeeksQuiz
            </code>

            <p>Let’s analyze the script line by line.</p>
            <p><b><i>Line 1: [# Script Begins]</i></b> In Python, comments begin with a #. This statement is ignored by the interpreter and serves as documentation for our code.</p>
            <p><b><i>Line 2: [print(“GeeksQuiz”)]</i></b> To print something on the console, print() function is used. This function also adds a newline after our message is printed(unlike in C). Note that in Python 2, “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.</p>
            <p><b><i>Line 3: [# Script Ends]</i></b> This is just another comment like in Line 1.</p>
